<center><span style="color:brown">We started our bike trip around 9:00AM after a breakfast at the Fairfield Inn.  Temperature was 60 degrees. Carl freaked us out when he said at breakfast before biking sixty miles: “Going to the gym to work out!”</span></center>

**<center><span style="color:Maroon">On our first day we biked 60 miles from Pittsburgh to Connellsville.   We lucked out and had a great day for our first ride.  Thankfully, without any accidents or rain.  We all got along - No one complained - No one fell behind.  This just might work out!</span></center>**

<center><b>Fearsome Foursome’s Thoughts of the Day: </b></center>
<b>
 <p style="color:DarkMagenta;">  Carl: "I am overwhelmed at the beauty, serenity and cleanliness of the trail and all the nice people we meet.  All of the service people we have met are exceptionally friendly.  The quality of the trail has been excellent - very smooth and well maintained.   We were so lucky to miss the rain.  It was all around us."</p>

<p style="color:blue">
C.:   "Who lit the fire under Mark’s ass?  Other than that,  good trail with awesome view and great riding company."</p>

<p style="color:ForestGreen"> 
Rob:  "Impressive trail and impressive people.  No trash on the trail was very noticeable."</p>

<p style="color:FireBrick"> 
Mark:  "C’s comment needs explanation!  He kept this torrid pace all day.  We exchanged lead rider occasionally to break the wind.  At my turn in the front, I merely was trying to keep the pace I thought they all wanted!  Otherwise, unbelievably impressed with nature and beauty of the trail."</p>

<center><b>Did the 60 mile ride tire you out in any way?</b></center>

<p style="color:DarkMagenta;"> Mark:  Not as tired as I thought I would be but my poor bum is glad to be off the bike saddle.  </p>

<p style="color:DarkMagenta;">
Carl:  Had to get up and down on the saddle a couple of times.
</p>
<p style="color:DarkMagenta;">
Rob: I was fine until the fuse was lit.

<p style="color:DarkMagenta;">
C:  No issues.  (Mr.Hard Ass)
