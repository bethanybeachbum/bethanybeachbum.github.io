##  Meeting Up For the GAP Bike Ride

The four riders drove from their various starting points, Virginia and Delaware, to Wheelzup 
Bike Shop in Cumberland, Md at around 12 noon.  There we were able to leave our bikes for the 
three day trip.  We loaded our bikes and gear into a shuttle van that Wheelzup Bike provides for
a fee per rider.  From Cumberland, Md the van drove us 3 hours to Pittsburgh, PA where we were 
dropped off at the downtown Fairfield Inn.  

Dinner was at the XXX restaurant.  Carb loading for the big event!
