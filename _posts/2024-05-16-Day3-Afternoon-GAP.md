<p style="color:DarkMagenta; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">Carl's Final Thoughts</p>
<p style="color:DarkMagenta; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold  ">Rekindled my spiritual connection to nature. 
Reinforced the importance of living a balanced life.
Seek the adventures beyond your routines.
Sharing an experience with an awesome group of guys.</p>

<p style="color:DarkGreen; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">C. Hirst's Final Thoughts</p>
<p style="color:DarkGreen; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">It's not always how fast or far you go, as long as you embrace the experience. Some new experiences for me was riding 150 miles on my mountain bike. Little harder than I imagined, plus the gear that was carried on the bike. Saw some amazing views that kept your mind of the long days pedaling. A variety of animals, waterfalls, bridges, scary high bridges, and tunnels. So many memories shared between the Fantastic Four.</p>


<p style="color:DarkGreen; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">Epilogue: wouldn't change a thing or do anything different other than try going in the other direction. In three days: biked 157.35 miles, climbed 3124 ft, burned 6231 calories!!! Ate my share of calamari and over indulged on gluten. You know what?? I felt fine, except I'm a little sore.</p>
<p style="color:DarkGreen; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">_______________________</p>



<p style="color:MidnightBlue; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">Rob's Final Thoughts</p>
<p style="color:MidnightBlue; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">The trip from Pittsburgh to Cumberland on the GAP was truly a great one which brought a great sense of accomplishment with all of the miles ridden, but I have to say that this trip was one measured in friends rather than miles. All of the people we met along the way made me realize that most people are good at heart. At one point we stopped to speak to a man who was walking the trail. I casually mentioned to my cohorts that I was out of water. This man then reached down into his cooler and gave me a fresh ice cold bottle. Before we rode on I said to him, in all sincerity, "It's great to be a part of your life, and now you're a part of mine. Thank you. He then smiled, nodded, and we rode on.</p>
<p style="color:MidnightBlue; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">______________________ </p>

 

<p style="color:Teal; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">Mark’s Final Thoughts</p>

<p style="color:Teal; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">This was an epic trip across a beautiful swath of America.  We traveled through a story of the steel industry long gone and mighty railroad companies that came and went.  Yet we witnessed a life of Americana that has endured…</p>

<p style="color:Teal; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">The ride on the GAP enriched my life and as Carl elucidated, our journey was life awakening in three ways: Spirituality, Mentally and Physically.</p>

<p style="color:Teal; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">Mentally, it is good for the soul to be around the beautiful flora and fauna of nature and the creatures we met: the chipmunks, the birds, the guinea hens, the snakes and the deer.  </p>

<p style="color:Teal; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">Physically, biking 150 miles is an exhausting experience that makes us realize our mortality yet at the same time what we’re capable of accomplishing.  The tiredness I feel is a reward for persevering the challenge.</p>

<p style="color:Teal; font-size:larger; font-weight:bold ">Spiritually, I saw a beautiful earth that God created and how it was meant to be.  Maybe, we need to rethink how we live together in big cities.</p>

The 100 Foot drop below down to the Cassellman River
For a majority of our trip you could hear the rushing rapids nearby.
</span></center>



### Placards along the trail tell the story that the Cassellman River has so many sharp bends at the Pinkerton Horn that the only solution for the railroad engineers was to dig the Pinkerton tunnel. 




<center><span style="color:DarkGreen">Mile 55 and pumping uphill.  The vibrant green Spring forests created a mood of sereneness and tranquility </span></center>





<span>
We reached the Pinkerton Horn after ten miles of biking.  Most of our trip the rail trail hugs the edge of fast flowing rivers which are famous for their white water rafting adventures.
</span>



<center><span style="color:DarkGreen">
At mile 44 - Just before Meyersdale we left the dense forest and rode onto the Salisbury viaduct for spectacular views across the valley.  The viaduct is over 1,900 feet long and over 100 feet high.
Built in 1912.  Stopped train usage in 1975.  Changed to bike trail in 1998.

## Near Meyersdale, this expanse of the railroad and its bridges were built in the early 1900s.
