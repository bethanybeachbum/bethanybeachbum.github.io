 Few trips are more fun and rewarding than biking the Great Allehany Passageway.  It follows former railroad paths of the old Western Maryland Railroad and several other defunct railroad companies from Pittsburgh through Pennsylvania to Cumberland, Maryland.

This 150-mile trail is one of the longest rail trails in the United States and offers amazing scenary while riding through southwestern Pennsylvania and western Maryland. The trail winds through the Laurel Highlands, Allegheny County, and downtown Pittsburgh.

## Who Is Biking the Trip

There are four of us planning to take the three day trip:
Rob Helminksy - Cat Man
C. Hurst - DIY Guy
Carl Roberts - Aussie
Mark Brown - Beachbum

Rob and Carl put the idea to bike the 150 mile GAP trail.  Mark got invited and we add C. Hurst.  C has done the other half of the trail from Cumberland, MD to Washington, DC.  It was decided that we will stay in hotels for three nights rather than camp.  All gear will be carried on our bikes.  We will eat at stops along the way along with a couple of protein bars packed in our bags.

The trail terrain is approximately 15% paved and 85% gravel surface.  There are rolling hills in places throughout the trail but the two ends of the trail are at roughly the same elevation. The highest evalation on the trail is the Eastern Continental Divide located 23.5 miles North of Cumberland. The trail climbs in both directions to reach Divide’s elevation of 2392 feet. The elevation gain from Cumberland is about 1800 feet and about 1700 feet from Pittsburgh.

There are many notable landmarks and beautiful views along the trail but a couple of stand outs are:

## Trail History

The Great Allegheny Passage as a bike trail is relatively new. A construction project of almost 30 years in the making, started in 1986 near Ohiopyle. The last section to be completed was the most Northern section from West Homestead to downtown Pittsburgh in June 2013. Being a former railroad, the trail is very flat, and once outside downtown Pittsburgh there is no motorized traffic.  

Most of the trail was built on the abandoned grades of the Western Maryland Railway through Connellsville, then on the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad on to Pittsburgh.

The lines were abandoned since 1975, and the first 9-mile (14 km) section of the rail trail opened near Ohiopyle, Pennsylvania, in 1866. In June 2013, thirty-five years after construction first began, the final section was completed from West Homestead to Pittsburgh at an overall cost of $80 million.
