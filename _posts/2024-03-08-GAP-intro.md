Biking the Great Alleghany Passageway via Biking
I’ve had tremendous opportunities to travel the world from Europe to Asia but few trips have been more fun and rewarding as biking the Great Allegheny Passage (GAP). it follows former railroad paths of the old Western Maryland Railroad and several other now non-existent railroad companies and goes from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Cumberland, Maryland.
This 150-mile trail is one of the longest rail trails in the United States and offers amazing views while riding through southwestern Pennsylvania and western Maryland. The trail is approximately 150 miles of which most are in Pennsylvania. The trail winds through the Laurel Highlands, Allegheny County, and downtown Pittsburgh.
The Great Allegheny Passage as a bike trail is relatively new. A construction project of almost 30 years in the making, started in 1986 near Ohiopyle. The last section to be completed was the most Northern section from West Homestead to downtown Pittsburgh in June 2013. Being a former railroad, the trail is very flat, and once outside downtown Pittsburgh there is no motorized traffic.
The trail terrain
Approximately 15% paved and 85% gravel surface.
There are rolling hills in places throughout the trail but the two ends of the trail are at roughly the same elevation. The highest evalation on the trail is the Eastern Continental Divide located 23.5 miles North of Cumberland. The trail climbs in both directions to reach Divide’s elevation of 2392 feet. The elevation gain from Cumberland is about 1800 feet and about 1700 feet from Pittsburgh.
￼ There are many notable landmarks and beautiful views along the trail but a couple of stand outs are:
	•	Continental Divide
	•	Ohiopyle High and Low Bridges
	•	The Long Tunnel
	•	30 miles from Connellsville to Confluence through Ohiopyle State Park
	•	 Great Passage Falls
