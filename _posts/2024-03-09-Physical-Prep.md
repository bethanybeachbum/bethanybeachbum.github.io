## Physical Preparation for the GAP

The GAP Bike trail is on a former railroad track so the grade is never too perilous but it a long way from Pittsburg, PA to Cumberland, MD on a bike! So it is important to get physically prepared. Three days at fifty miles per day is more than most of us ever do for regular exercise so it is important to do some practice trips of at least twenty-five miles each.

If it is the first time using panniers, one should put them on the bike loaded with gear and go for a ride to get used the weight and physical presence of the panniers.  Any other bike accessories or changes to your bike should definetly tried out before the trek down the trail.  The last thing you want to discover a couple miles into a 150 mile bike ride is that something about your bike, gear or clothing is not going to work or be aggrevating.

If you are overweight, a couple months before the ride is the time to encentivize yourself to lose a couple of pounds to make your ride a whole lot more enjoyable.  And remember, you can't exercise your way out of a bad diet. Proper nutrition is paramount.  Avoid ultra-processed foods, minimize sugar, and stop consuming seed oils! Most cookies, crackers and snack foods are loaded with seed oils which are terrible for your diet.  Buckle up and eliminate them!

If you belong to a gym, get in there a couple days a week several months in advance.  Emphasize the leg workouts:  squats, split squat, bulgarian squats, romanian deal lifts.  Mix in some whole body exercises such as cleans and dead lifts.  Avoid machines that only work a couple of muscle groups.  Maximize your time in the gym with the above mentioned exercises.

Personally, I prefer kettlebells, because they force you to work so many muscles groups, but a barbell and dumbbells are fine.  Just get out and do it.
