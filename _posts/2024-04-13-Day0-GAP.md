For bikers and adventure travelers few trips are more fun and rewarding than traveling the Great Allehany Passageway or GAP. It follows former railroad paths of the old Western Maryland Railroad and several other defunct railroad companies from Pittsburgh through Pennsylvania to Cumberland, Maryland.

This 150-mile trail is one of the longest rail trails in the United States and offers amazing scenary while riding through southwestern Pennsylvania and western Maryland.

Rob and Carl put together the idea to bike the 150 mile GAP trail.  Mark got invited and we added C. Hurst.  C has done the other half of the trail from Cumberland, MD to Washington, DC so we looking forward to his insightful recommendations.  We decided to stay in hotels for three nights rather than camp.  All gear will be carried on our bikes.  We will eat at stops along the way.


We rendevouzed at Wheelzup Bike Shop in Cumberland, Md to arrive around 12 noon.  We were able to leave our cars for the three day trip at a public parking lot near WheelzUp.  We loaded our bikes and gear into a shuttle van that Wheelzup Bike provides on a fee basis.  From Cumberland, Md the van drove us 2 1/2 hours to Pittsburgh, PA where we were dropped off at the downtown Fairfield Inn.

Found the marker for the terminus of the GAP trail at the down town park of Fort Pitt where the three rivers meet.</p>

<p style="color:FireBrick">Carl and C tried the Cavatelli Salsiccia.  Mark had the Bronzino fish.  Rob went out on a limb with spaghetti and red sauce or Spaghetti Pomodoro.  And of course there was another dish of Tira-mi-su that was voted better than that at the sandwich shop.</p></div>
