##  All the Right Gear at the Right Time

 Nothing is worse than missing essential gear on a three day bike ride.  On the flip side lugging unnecessary gear for 150 miles over three days can contribute to a miserable ride.  We are here to make sure you pack the ride gear for overnight rides.  Here are the essential items to bring along when on a bike ride, without weighing you down.

1. Obviously a bike. However which bike?  Since this trail is 85% hard packed gravel I recommend a hybrid bike.  My choice is the Trek FX2 in red.
