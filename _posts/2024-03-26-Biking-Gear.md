##  All the Right Gear at the Right Time

 For an enjoyable adventure it is important to insure that one has the essential gear for a three day bike ride.  On the flip side lugging unnecessary gear for 150 miles over three days can contribute to a less than fun experience.  Here are the essential items to bring along when on a bike ride, without weighing you down.

 And remember:  this gear list is for those stayig in hotels along the way.  If you are camping each night, your essential packing list becomes a bit longer.

1.  Obviously you need a bike. However which bike?  Since this trail is 85% hard packed gravel I recommend a hybrid bike.  My choice is the Trek FX2 Disc in red. I don't except any endorsements for this recommendations.  The FX2 series from Trek runs less than $800.  Sometimes a little more or less depending on what features that Trek or the bike store has added to it.  This bike is just one of many that will work for your trip.

2. Panniers  - don't skimp on them and make sure they are waterproof.

3. Sunglasses
4. Bike shorts
5. Rain Jacket
6. Cycling Gloves
7. Cycling Shoes For Clip-In or sneakers for Clip-less Pedals
8. Bike Helmet
9. First Aid Kit
10. Head light or bike light
11. Patch Kit and Tire Levers
12. Allen Wrenches
13. Pump / Mini-inflator
14. Waterbottles
15. Sun Protection
16. Energy Snacks and Electrolyte Drinks
17. Mobile Phone

22. Optional:  Route Map
23. Optional:  Pocket Knife
24. Optional:  Off Bike Clothing
25. Optional:  Off Bike Sandals

26: Optional:  Speed and Cadence sensors communicating to a bike computer or bike application.
    I have used both bike applications and bike computers and they both accompllish the same thing.  On this trip I am using the CYCPLUS speed and cadence sensors that communicate via bluetooth to the Cadence app on my iPhone.  I like the feature of both cadence and speed tracking -- let's see if I am able to find both sensors productive.  On my other bike I use the CATEYE Patron bike computer. It does not track cadence. It works well but I am interested in trying something new.  They CYCPLUS sensors are approximately $32 and the Cadence app is free with some annoying ads.  May have to try another app!  The Patron bike computer runs $55.

In all categories, go as light and compact as possible.  There are bike stores at each end of the GAP and several along the way in towns to pick up any other essentials.
